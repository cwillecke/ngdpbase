# Addon Page Handling

> See also: [`addons-developer-guide.md` → Seed Wiki Pages](../guides/addons-developer-guide.md#seed-wiki-pages) for the how-to, and [`addon-architecture.md`](./addon-architecture.md) for load order. This document is the reference for __where addon pages live, how they're named, and what does (and does not) sync__ to a running instance.

---

## Two locations — don't conflate them

An addon page exists in two distinct places with different rules:

| | Path | Naming | Mutability |
|---|---|---|---|
| __Source__ (ships with the addon) | `addons/<addon>/pages/*.md` | __Name-based__ (`geohazardwatch-about.md`, `Landslides.md`) | Read-only seed material; edited in the addon repo |
| __Runtime__ (in the instance) | `<data>/pages/{uuid}.md` (a vault page → `<data>/pages/vaults/{owner}/{vault}/{uuid}.md`) | __UUID-based, always__ | The live page; operator-editable |

`<data>` is the instance pages directory (`ngdpbase.page.provider.filesystem.storagedir`, under `SLOW_STORAGE`). It is the __same store as every other page__ — addon pages are not kept in the addon directory at runtime.

### Why the two naming schemes

- __Source files are name-based__ purely for human readability in the addon repo. The seeder ignores the filename entirely — it reads the frontmatter `uuid` and `slug`. A source file could be UUID-named too; there's just no benefit.
- __Runtime files are UUID-named__ because `FileSystemProvider.resolvePageFilePath()` returns `{uuid}.md` unconditionally, and the page index / slug resolution / routing all key on UUID.

> __A name-based file inside `<data>/pages/` is never indexed__ — it's an orphan. If you find `data/pages/Landslides.md` alongside `data/pages/{uuid}.md`, something copied source files into the data volume *outside* the seed pipeline. That's the class of bug tracked in [#908](https://github.com/jwilleke/ngdpbase/issues/908) (ngdpbase side) and [geohazardwatch#139](https://github.com/jwilleke/geohazardwatch/issues/139) (deployment side). See [Orphans](#orphans--name-based-files-in-datapages) below.

## The seed pipeline

`AddonsManager.seedAddonPages()` runs inside `loadAddon()` on __every server boot__, right after the addon's `register()`. For each `addons/<addon>/pages/*.md`:

Since [#1406](https://github.com/jwilleke/ngdpbase/issues/1406) the addon seed hands each folder to `PageManager.seedShippedPages()`, the same seeder required pages use:

1. Parse frontmatter — a valid __`uuid`__ (the 8-4-4-4-12 hex form, not only UUID v4), a __`title`__ and a __`slug`__ are required, and two files may not share a uuid; otherwise the file is reported (an error for a domain addon, a warning otherwise, plus an admin notification).
2. __Lookup by uuid__ — a page this site holds under that uuid first gets its `addon-source-hash` backfilled if it has none and its text matches the source ([#1408](https://github.com/jwilleke/ngdpbase/issues/1408); a metadata-only save that keeps `lastModified` and writes no version). A page with no stamp whose text differs is left unstamped and logged. The page is then left to the addon's own steps (the #971 / #1003 metadata tidy-ups and nothing that changes its text: see [Updating seeded pages](#updating-seeded-pages-920-2389)), then re-indexed for search by title.
3. __Seeded once per site__ — the site's record, `${FAST_STORAGE}/seeded-shipped-pages.json` (source `addon:<name>`), lists every page it has seeded. A recorded page that is no longer live was removed on this site and is not seeded again, whatever the provider. A uuid in the trash is recorded and skipped. A site without a record starts it from its live and trashed pages.
4. Otherwise `pageManager.savePage(title, content, metadata)` writes `<data>/pages/{uuid}.md` with `addon`, `system-category` (`addon` if absent), `addon-source-category`, a default `access` for the category, `addon-source-hash`, `created` and `lastModified`, and indexes it for search by title.

The lookup is by uuid only. A source page whose __slug__ or __title__ is already used by a page with a __different uuid__ is not treated as seeded: the save is refused as a conflict. Since [#1412](https://github.com/jwilleke/ngdpbase/issues/1412) that is a status, not a boot failure — it is logged at info as `Shipped pages could not be seeded: <title> (<file>): <reason>`, with no notification, and the page shows as __UUID Mismatch__ in Required Pages Sync. An admin can reconcile it there or click __Don't Seed Here__, which records the uuid as declined for that source in `${FAST_STORAGE}/seeded-shipped-pages.json`; the seeder then skips it until the decline is undone or the page is synced explicitly.

Seeding is __boot-time only__ — there is no file-watcher and no install-event trigger. A __restart is required__ for any seed pass to run.

## What syncs to an existing instance

On restart, comparing the addon's current `pages/` against an already-seeded instance:

| Change to `addons/<addon>/pages/` | Synced? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| __New__ page (new UUID, never seeded here) | ✅ __Yes__ | Not live and not in the site's seeded record → `savePage` seeds it |
| __Updated__ content of a seeded page | 🖐 Admin | Never at start-up. Shows as Update ready in Required Pages Sync; Sync All or the row's Update button applies it to a page nobody edited here — see [Updating seeded pages](#updating-seeded-pages-920-2389) |
| __Deleted__ source page | ❌ No | There is no removal logic; the instance copy persists indefinitely ([#920](https://github.com/jwilleke/ngdpbase/issues/920) discusses a gated policy) |
| __Renamed slug__ (same UUID) | ❌ No (skipped) | The UUID guard matches — the page keeps its old slug |
| Instance page __deleted by an operator__ | ❌ No (skipped) | The site's record says it was seeded, so it was removed on purpose — also after the trash purges it, and with `filesystemprovider`, which has no trash ([#1403](https://github.com/jwilleke/ngdpbase/issues/1403), [#1405](https://github.com/jwilleke/ngdpbase/issues/1405)). It comes back through a restore from the trash or an admin's Sync in Required Pages Sync |

So __additions always flow; updates flow only when an admin presses Sync All (unedited pages) or Use shipped version; deletions and renames do not.__

Purging a trash entry whose uuid is also a live page removes only the trash file and entry; the version folder belongs to the live page and is kept ([#1403](https://github.com/jwilleke/ngdpbase/issues/1403)).

### Updating seeded pages (#920, #2389)

Every seeded page carries an __`addon-source-hash`__ in frontmatter — the trimmed SHA-256 of the body it was seeded or last synced with. __Start-up never replaces a page the site already holds.__ It adds pages that are not on the site yet, stamps a page that already matches the source ([#1408](https://github.com/jwilleke/ngdpbase/issues/1408)), and fixes metadata (category drift, author) without touching the text. A newer addon page reaches the site only through __Required Pages Sync__.

The state of each page is one function, `shippedPageState()` in `src/utils/addonPageSync.ts`, the same for core and addon pages ([#2389](https://github.com/jwilleke/ngdpbase/issues/2389)):

| State | Meaning | Sync All |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Same as shipped | The text matches the source and nobody edited the page here | nothing to do |
| Update ready | The source changed and the page was never edited here | replaces it |
| Edited here, not confirmed | The page was changed on this site: saved in the editor (`user-modified`, even if only the title or keywords changed), has no stamp, or its text no longer matches its stamp | leaves it |
| Edited here, and a newer version is available | Edited here, and the source also changed | leaves it |

A page with no `addon-source-hash` is never replaced: its edit state cannot be proven, so it reads Edited here, not confirmed. Since #1408 a legacy page whose text already matches the source is stamped at boot, so only legacy pages that differ remain, and an admin chooses __Use shipped version__ on each.

__`ngdpbase.addons.page-reseed` is retired.__ It used to refresh unedited addon pages at every restart (default `false`). It now does nothing; boot logs *"ngdpbase.addons.page-reseed is retired; add-on pages update through Admin › Required Pages Sync"* when it is `true`. A site that had it on now sees those pages as __Update ready__ until an admin presses __Sync All__ at `/admin/required-pages` ([#513](https://github.com/jwilleke/ngdpbase/issues/513)). The status table is the preview, and the row's __Update__ button or __Sync All__ applies it on demand, no restart. __Use shipped version__ replaces an edited page, after a confirm; the edited version stays in the page history. There is no dedicated `POST /admin/addons/:addonName/reseed` REST route — Required Pages Sync is the entry point.

[#920](https://github.com/jwilleke/ngdpbase/issues/920) is __closed__, along with both follow-ups it had been holding open:

- __Removed-source-page policy__ ([#930](https://github.com/jwilleke/ngdpbase/issues/930)) — see [Source-removed pages](#source-removed-pages-930) below.
- __Unified modified-detection__ ([#931](https://github.com/jwilleke/ngdpbase/issues/931)) — the core list, the addon list and Sync all call `shippedPageState()` in `src/utils/addonPageSync.ts` ([#2389](https://github.com/jwilleke/ngdpbase/issues/2389)), so one surface cannot report a page differently from another.

### Source-removed pages (#930)

When an addon stops shipping a page it previously seeded, the instance copy is __left in place and flagged__ — nothing is deleted automatically. `AddonsManager.findOrphanedAddonPages()` narrows candidates via the indexed `system-category: addon`, attributes each to its addon through the `addon` frontmatter stamp, and diffs against that addon's current source UUID set. Detection is best-effort: with no search index available it returns `[]` rather than guessing, because a detection bug must never become a deletion.

Removal is __opt-in, per page, from Required Pages Sync__. The server re-verifies that each selected page is still genuinely source-removed before acting — the client's list is never trusted — and deletes through `PageManager` so a revertable version is kept. Pages the operator has edited are reported with `userModified` set so the flag can be weighed before removing anything.

> __Containerized instances:__ editing `addons/*/pages/` in a git repo does nothing to a running pod until the image is rebuilt/redeployed *and* the container restarts. For an image like geohazardwatch, that means bumping the addon/base-image version so the new `.md` is present, then restarting.

### Why updates default to frozen

The idempotency guard exists so an addon upgrade can never clobber a page the operator edited in-app. Updates therefore don't propagate at start-up. [Required Pages Sync](#updating-seeded-pages-920-2389) lifts this __for unedited pages only__ (Sync All) — edited pages are always left alone until an admin chooses Use shipped version. Removals still never propagate.

## A deleted instance copy is not seeded again

Start-up never replaces a page's text, and a page needs an `addon-source-hash` stamp to ever count as unedited (see the bootstrap note above).

__Try the admin surface first.__ For an unedited page, Required Pages Sync at `/admin/required-pages` updates it on demand with no restart and no config change — see [Updating seeded pages](#updating-seeded-pages-920-2389) above.

Deleting the instance file and restarting does __not__ seed it again: the site's seeded-pages record treats a removed page as removed on purpose. Bring it back from Required Pages Sync, or restore it from the trash. Operator-edited pages are left in place by the boot reseed and by the sync surface. Deleting the source file does __not__ remove the instance copy.

## Orphans — name-based files in `<data>/pages/`

Seeding only ever writes `{uuid}.md` with the auto-set fields. A __name-based__ file in the data pages directory that lacks `addon`/`created`/`lastModified` did __not__ come through the seed pipeline — it was copied in out-of-band (a manual `cp`, a backup/restore, a volume mount, or a pre-fix image). Such files are inert (the UUID-keyed index never sees them) but clutter the store and confuse audits.

- Diagnosis: on the live instance, `inotifywait -m <data>/pages` across one restart+seed will name whatever writes them.
- Cleanup: a name-based file that has a matching `{uuid}.md` (same `uuid` in frontmatter) is safe to delete — nothing serves it.

See [geohazardwatch#139](https://github.com/jwilleke/geohazardwatch/issues/139) for the canonical write-up and the addon-side handling rules (ship pages only in `addons/*/pages/`; never copy them into the data volume).
